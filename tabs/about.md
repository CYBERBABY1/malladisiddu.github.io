Hi there,
I am a 3rd year Electronics and Communication Engineering undergraduate at [Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham](https://www.amrita.edu/), Bangalore campus, India.
I love to explore to everything possible which amuses me, that habbit of exploring everything introduced me to CTF and I never looked back.

Also I love to travel, and when I travel I'm really interested in teh place's history, although I haven't started writing any arcticles on history in my blog, soon I will start.
I believe in,

> आत्मनस्तु कामाय सर्वं प्रियं भवति ।
