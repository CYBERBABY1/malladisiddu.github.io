Hi there,
I am a 3rd year Electronics and Communication Engineering undergraduate at [Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham](https://www.amrita.edu/), Bangalore campus, India.
I love to explore to everything possible which amuses me, that habbit of exploring everything introduced me to CTF and I never looked back.

My love towards mathematics put me in cryptography. I made a decryption tool named [ZCrypt - Basic Deryption Tool](https://github.com/malladisiddu/ZCrypt) for all crypto enthusiasts which comes in handy especially while playing CTF's. 

Also I love to travel, and when I travel I'm really interested in the place's history, although I haven't started writing any arcticles on history in my blog, soon I will start.
I believe in,

> आत्मनस्तु कामाय सर्वं प्रियं भवति ।
